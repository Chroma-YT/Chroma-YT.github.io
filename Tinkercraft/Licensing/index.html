        <h1>Licensing</h1>
        <h3>What a mess!</h3>
        <p>Tinkercraft takes resources from many (open-source, publicly licensed) resource and data packs to expand its library. One side effect of this, however, is the many different licenses from with these packs spring. This page is dedicated to fulfilling the licensing requirements for all packs on Tinkercraft.</p>
        <h2>Tinkercraft Core License</h2>
        <p>This license describes how all packs made explicitly for Tinkercraft (By Tinkercraft devs) are to be licensed under.</p>
        <p><br><h4>You CAN:</h4>- Use your custom Tinkercraft pack(s) for private use or distribution.<br>- Feature your packs in videos without crediting Tinkercraft.<br>- Publicly distribute your Tinkercraft pack, provided that it is distributed through a Tinkercraft download link.<br>- Publish a modified version of a Tinkercraft pack under any license, provided that you give Tinkercraft a copy of your modification to add to their library.</p>
        <p><br><h4>You CANNOT:</h4>- Publicly distribute Tinkercraft packs without explicit authorization from Tinkercraft.<br>- Claim legal ownership of your Tinkercraft pack.<br>- Publicly distribute your Tinkercraft pack in its unmodified form, whether it is for profit or not (Profit includes ad money!).<br>- Use Tinkercraft packs in any form, directly or indirectly to train any AI or neural network model.</p>
        <p><br><h4>NOTES:</h4>- Tinkercraft reserves the right to change or override this license on an individual or public basis at any time.<br>- Tinkercraft reserves the right to restrict or prevent usage by any one individual or group for any reason.</p>
        <p><h4>Tinkercraft Core Packs:</h4>- Fresh Crops (Inspired by bebesta_loste's Fancy Crops)<br>- Immersive UI (Inspired by Kingbyu's Colorful Containers)<br>- Modern Creepers (Remixed Creeper texture from ALthegator's AL's Creepers Revamped)</p>
        <h2>MIT License</h2>
        <p>This license essentially says that you can do whatever you want to, provided that you give a copy of it in any works that you produce with it. In the case of Tinkercraft, this means that our versions of these packs (Such as Grand World, which is a custom config of Tectonic), apply to the Tinkercraft Core License, but you can find the original packs as well.</p>
        <p><br>Copyright &lt;YEAR&gt; &lt;COPYRIGHT HOLDER&gt;<br>Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the “Software”), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:<br><br>The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.<br><br>THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

        <p><h4>MIT Licensed Packs:</h4>- Grand World (Custom config settings for Apollo's Tectonic)<br>- Cursed Mobs (Knarfy's Broken Mobs)<br>- Scrumptious Skulk (notandvm's emissive skulk!)<br>- Cave Mode (Custom modification of Klinbee's Chaotic Caverns World)</p>
        <h2>Vanilla Tweaks</h2>
        <p>Some of the packs on Tinkercraft are derived from Tinkercraft's inspiration site, Vanilla Tweaks. You can find the original packs from Vanilla Tweaks <a href="https://vanillatweaks.net">HERE</a>.</p>
        <p><h4>Vanilla Tweaks Packs:</h4>- Unique Dyes (By MMStinks)<br>- Mob Pixel Consistency<br>- Particle Pixel Consistency</p>
        <h2>Minecraft EULA</h2>
        <p>This is the agreement between you, me and Minecraft. It essentially says that you can do whatever you want, provided you don't imitate them, and they can stop you whenever. This just applies to stuff made by Mojang, such as old textures or sounds, as well as "fixes" for consistency within the game.</p>
        <p><h4>Packs from Minecraft:</h4>- Wood for Boomers<br>- Ores for Boomers<br>- Gravel for Boomers<br>- Plants for Boomers<br>- Wool for Boomers<br>- Shulkers for Boomers<br>- Cobble for Boomers<br>- Netherack for Boomers<br>- Minecraft for Boomers<br>- Pigman!<br>- Oof!<br>- I Hate Panoramas!</p>
        <h2>Assorted Goodies</h2>
        <p>This is a category for pretty much everything else. If I cannot find the license for something, or an idea for a pack is so simple it simply cannot be owned (Think Smoother Fences, it does nothing except rotate some textures), or there are so many different versions of a certain thing that it is ubiquitous (Think Dark UI, there are thousands of Dark Mode packs out there), then they go here! Please open a bug report if you find any errors or wish to clarify the licensing on your project on our GitHub.</p>
        <p><h4>Assorted Goodies:</h4>- Smooth Fences<br>- Transparent UI<br>- Dark UI<br>- Block Pixel Consistency<br>- Consistent Buckets<br>- Dripleaf Fix<br>- Soul Soil Campfire<br>- Consistent Pots</p>
